The FBI is investigating the shooting as an act of domestic terrorism and a possible hate crime; no charges have been filed.[5][6] The attacker released a manifesto before the attack, expressing support for and inspiration by the Christchurch mosque shootings, along with worry about Hispanic invasion, automation, large corporations, and environmental degradation. He quoted that \"Hispanics will take control of the local and state government of my beloved Texas, changing policy to better suit their needs.\"[7]\\n',\n",
